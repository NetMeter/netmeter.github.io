        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Our ongoing efforts to enhance extension accuracy and website support.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <span class="faq-question">How do you measure bandwidth usage?</span>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We use several lightweight signals to estimate your data usage. Along with reading the Content-Length header, we apply carefully controlled patches to APIs like fetch, XHR, WebRTC, WebSocket, SSE, Beacon, native video/audio, and certain workers.
            <br><br>
            These patches run quietly inside the page context and never alter how the site behaves. By combining all these sources, we provide accurate inbound and outbound bandwidth estimates without affecting your browsing experience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <span class="faq-question">Do these patches affect website performance?</span>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            No. The instrumentation is minimal, non-intrusive, and designed to leave the website’s functionality completely unchanged. Everything continues to work as usual—you simply get clearer insight into your bandwidth usage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <span class="faq-question">Why are some websites not supported?</span>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Supporting websites requires significant development effort to ensure our extension functions correctly on each site. Due to the dynamic nature of the internet and diverse web structures, it can be challenging to support every website immediately. We prioritize popular and frequently visited websites.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <span class="faq-question">How can I request support for a specific website?</span>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            We value user feedback! You can submit website requests through our contact email or by leaving a review on the Chrome Web Store. Your feedback helps us prioritize which sites to work on next.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <span class="faq-question">Do you log my credentials or browsing history?</span>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            <strong>No.</strong> Your privacy and security are our top priorities. We do not log your credentials, browsing history, or any sensitive information. All measurement logic runs locally on your device, and we do not collect or store your browsing sessions on our servers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <span class="faq-question">What should I do if I encounter issues?</span>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            If a website is not behaving as expected, try refreshing the page. If the issue persists, please report it to us at <strong>netmeter-ext@gmail.com</strong>. You can also temporarily disable the extension for specific sites via the popup toggle.
